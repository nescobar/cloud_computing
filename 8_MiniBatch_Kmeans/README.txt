The detailed report can be found in the document: escobarn_HarpMBKmeans_report
It includes the details of the implementation and an analysis of the output clusters

———————————————————————————
2. Bonus Points Report
———————————————————————————

The Bonus Points report can be found in the document: escobarn_Project8_BonusPoints
It includes the details of the experiments done on local VM and FutureSystems nodes

3. Source Code, JAR and logs
———————————————————————————

Source code for our implementation can be found in source/src/main/java/edu/iu/kmeansminibatch

Files are:
1. KmeansMiniBatchMapCollective.java
2. KmeansMiniBatchMapper.java
3. KMeansMiniBatchConstants.java

Compiled jar can be found in source/target/harp-tutorial-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Parameters for running our application are the following:

hadoop jar harp-tutorial-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar edu.iu.kmeansminibatch.KmeansMiniBatchMapCollective 
                <batchSize> <numOfMappers> <numOfIterations> <numOfCentroids> <workDir>

We have also included a log folder that includes the logs of one of the executions tests
done with our Mini Batch Kmeans application.
